This visualiser is made using the bizualizer addon which can be downloaded from the link below    
[Blender Bizualizer Addon](https://github.com/doakey3/Bizualizer)    

Download the zip file of addon and add the plugin by going in the preferences in blender.    

This template is made for the song Painting Greys by Emmit Fenn and the song has been included in the folder.    
To sync the song with the animation template, either render the template with audio in blender or you can just render the template and add
audio using other software like Adobe After Effects or Windows Video Editor or any of your preference.    
To use the same template with another song, just go to video editing layer and change the song and the end frame.    


Hope you like the result.
