This animation scene is made using the in built modifiers and shaders.

This template is made for the song Little Do You Know by Alex & Sierra and the song has been included in the folder. To sync the song with the animation template, either render the template with audio in blender or you can just render the template and add audio using other software like Adobe After Effects or Windows Video Editor or any of your preference. To use the same template with another song, just go to video editing layer and change the song and the end frame.

Changes can be made by adding more modifiers or changing the existing ones and changing the key frames.   

If you want to keep the same scene and change the song, just change the ending frame with the required one, modify the keyframes if needed and the render it.   

Hope you like the result.
