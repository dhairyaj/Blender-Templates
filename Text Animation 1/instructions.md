This is a text animation blend file.   

Changes that can be incorporated:   

- Change the text as you desire
- Change the colors and other properties in the shader
- Change camera angles
- Camera movement can also be added

To use the file, make the required changes and then render it. Background music can also be added to the animation either by adding in blender before rendering 
or adding the music separately afte rendering the animation using Windows Video Editor, Adobe After Effects or any software of your choice.   

Hope you all like the work.
