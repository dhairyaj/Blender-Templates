This visualiser is made using the in built modifiers.

This template is made for the song Capital Letters by Hailee Steinfeld & Nloodpop and the song has been included in the folder.
To sync the song with the animation template, either render the template with audio in blender or you can just render the template and add audio using other software like Adobe After Effects or Windows Video Editor or any of your preference.
To use the same template with another song, just go to video editing layer and change the song and the end frame.

Changes can be made by adding more modifiers or changing the existing ones and changing the key frames.

Hope you like the result.
